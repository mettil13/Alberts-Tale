# Albert's Tale

Little game for the project for the Programming course at the University of Bologna A.A. 2020/2021.

> Albert is the name of the snowman in the first level.

To compile the project is required to have `make` and `g++` installed **on Windows** (it's suggested to use MinGW):
```txt
cd src

make
```

To remove the object files use `make clean`.  
To also remove the final executable use `make rmproper`.

To modify any parameter edit the "util/Config.hpp" and "util/Config.cpp" files and recompile the project.

The makefile used is originally from https://github.com/carrieje/mysetup
